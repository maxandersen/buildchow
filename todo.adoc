= Questions


not the same maven version used for steps!? grep mavenName

why using ${WORKSPACE}/ instead of just relative paths ?


why is the unpack content put into sources potentially overwriting stuff in there ? 
Should it not be unpacked separately ?


where does BUILD_DESCRIPTION= come from ?
